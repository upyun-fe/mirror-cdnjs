# Mirror of cdnjs by UPYUN

## Why mirror?
[cdnjs](http://cdnjs.com) is excellent service which powered by Cloudflare. But cloudfalre's cdn is not stable in China mainland's Internet enviroment. So, as one of the backbone cdn providers in China, UPYUN create a mirror for it.
This will combine cloudflare's epic work in cdnjs project and UPYUN's cdn services for Chinese users.

## Differences
Every lib is sync with [cdnjs.com](http://cdnjs.com), the only difference is the url for each lib, we hosted them in `mirror-cdnjs.b0.upaiyun.com` instead of `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`.
